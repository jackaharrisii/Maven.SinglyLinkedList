I used sample code from crunchify.com as the starter code
https://crunchify.com/how-to-implement-a-linkedlist-class-from-scratch-in-java/

Crunchify's testing was garbage (all System.out.print, no actual tests)
I wrote five actual tests on the functionality of the code (constructor, add, remove, etc) - 4/5 failed
I went back to the code and started tinkering until those tests passed

Once the base tests were all passing, I started adding in the rest of the methods
